Javadoc Reloaded
======================

The Javadoc Reloaded project transforms arbitrary Javadoc API folders into fully fledged searchable webapps from the 21st century. It's a proposal for <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/225">JEP 225</a> crafted by <a href="http://winterbe.com">Benjamin Winterberg</a>.

#### Demo: http://winterbe.com/projects/javadoc-reloaded/javase/8/api/

### Compatibility

The tool is written in Java 8 and built with Maven 3. The frontend is tested and optimized for current desktop browser versions (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). If you find any issues related to Internet Explorer or other browsers, please let me know.

### Known issues

The frontend is currently missing keyboard navigation through search results. It's also not optimized for mobile browsers at the moment. This may be subject to future work. Just send me your feedback about missing features or bugs by <a href="https://github.com/winterbe/javadoc-reloaded/issues">opening an issue</a>.

### Contribute
